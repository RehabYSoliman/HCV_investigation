E.1.2 Term: Chronic hepatitis C
E.1.2 System Organ Class: 10021881 - Infections and infestations
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: This trial will study the treatment effectiveness of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 or 24 weeks, in patients infected with genotype 3 hepatitis C virus, with advanced liver disease (cirrhosis), who are slow responders to treatment with persistent virus after the first two weeks of treatment. 

This trial will answer if identifying patients by their viral response during treatment (whether the virus is cleared after the first two weeks) can guide the duration of therapy required to achieve cure. 
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: This study will compare the tolerability and side effects experienced by patients treated with 12 or 24 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Specifically it will study the frequency of serious adverse events and requirements for stopping treatment prematurely. The study will evaluate quality of life following treatment, using a standardised questionnaire.

E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The primary endpoint of the PK Lead-in Phase is to determine steady-state PK, is AUCtau of VEL, SOF, and its major metabolite (GS-331007).
The primary endpoint of the Treatment Phase is assessment of any AEs with a focus on AEs that lead to discontinuation of study drug.
E.5.1.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: PK lead in phase - Day 7
Treatment phase - SVR 12 weeks
E.5.2 Secondary end point(s): The secondary endpoints of the PK Lead-in Phase are:
-  Antiviral activity measurements, including assessment of HCV RNA from baseline through Day 7.
- Any AE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug.
The secondary endpoints of the Treatment Phase are:
- The proportion of subjects with sustained virological response (SVR) 12 weeks after cessation of treatment (SVR12). SVR12 is the key efficacy endpoint.
- The proportion of subjects with HCV RNA < LLOQ at 4 or 24 weeks after cessation of treatment (SVR4 and SVR24).
- The proportion of subjects with virologic failure, including breakthrough/nonresponse and relapse
- The proportion of subjects with HCV RNA < LLOQ on treatment
- Emergence of viral resistance to SOF and /or VEL during treatment and treatment is discontinued

E.1.1.2 Therapeutic area: Diseases [C] - Virus Diseases [C02]
MedDRA Classification
E.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:
E.1.2 Version: 20.0
E.1.2 Level: PT
E.1.2 Classification code: 10019744
E.1.2 Term: Hepatitis C
E.1.2 System Organ Class: 10021881 - Infections and infestations
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The main objective of the study is to evaluate the proportion of patients who clear the virus (have no detectable virus in their blood) at 12 weeks post end of treatment following SOF/VEL for 6 weeks (short treatment duration) as compared with 12 weeks (standard treatment duration) in people with recent HCV infection (duration of infection less than or equal to 12 months).
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: The study has several secondary objectives as follows:
1) To assess effectiveness in the two groups (short treatment duration group and standard treatment duration group) by looking at the proportion of people who clear the virus  at the end of treatment, and 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment; 
2) To look at whether people get reinfected with HCV during the study and up to 2 years following treatment and if so, why; 
3) To examine what factors may influence viral clearance, such as a person's genes that influence the immune system and variations in the hepatitis C virus that might make the virus more susceptible or resistant to treatment. Genes are made of DNA – the chemical structure carrying the genetic information that determines many human characteristics such as the colour of your eyes or hair. Understanding a person’s genes may be able to explain why some people respond to a treatment, while others do not, or why some people experience a side effect and others do not;
4) To evalu

E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: 1) Willing and able to provide written informed consent;
2) Have either previously participated in a Gilead-sponsored HCV study and received a sofosbuvir-containing regimen without interferon; OR At pre-selected sites only, have received an all-oral SOF-based regimen outside a clinical study. These subjects must have documentation of the regimen, start and end of treatment dates (month and year), and of
having achieved SVR12
3) Have achieved SVR either in a Gilead-sponsored study, as defined in the treatment protocol; OR for subjects who enroll after receiving an alloral SOF-based regimen outside a clinical study, SVR will be defined as HCV RNA < LLOQ approximately 12 weeks following last dose of treatment.
4) Have liver cirrhosis, as defined in the treatment protocol, and have not had a liver transplant after receiving a SOF-containing regimen; OR Subjects who enroll after receiving an all-oral SOF-based regimen outside a clinical study, will have had cirrhosis as diagnosed prior to initiation of HCV Treatment.
E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: 1) Subject plans to initiate a new course of HCV therapy, including approved products and any
investigational agents, during the course of this Registry;

The proportion of subjects who develop liver disease progression or regression, as assessed by clinical and laboratory parameters throughout the study

The proportion of subjects who develop HCC through Week 240.
E.5.2 Secondary end point(s): To determine whether subsequent detection of HCV RNA in subjects who relapse following
SVR represents the re-emergence of pre-existing virus, the development of resistance
mutations, or re-infection.
E.5.2.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: The proportion of subjects with detectable HCV RNA due to re-emergence of pre-existing
virus through Week 240;

The proportion of subjects with detectable HCV resistance mutations through Week 240.

The proportion of subjects with detectable HCV RNA due to re-infection through Week 240.
