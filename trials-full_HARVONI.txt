Compare the adverse events- and sustanied viral response rates between the two groups of patients in each treatment arm in relation to demographic, biological and genetic factors. 

E.2.1 Main objective of the trial (da): Del 1 
Vi ønsker at undersøge hyppigheden af bivirkninger af patienter med kronisk hepatitis C, genotype 1, randomiseret til behandling i 12 uger med Viekira PAK® og ribavirin versus Harvoni® og ribavirin. 

Vi ønsker at sammenligne hyppigheden af bivirkninger og helbredelses raten mellem de to grupper af patienter i hver behandlingsarm i forhold til demografisk data samt biologiske og genetiske faktorer.


E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To investigate, by population sequencing for resistance associated varients, hepatitis C virus isolated from all patients who fail treatment in the randomised study described above both at baseline and post-treatment failure. 

Examine the effect of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with and without ribavirin for 12 weeks on the hepatic venous pressure gradient, systemic blood pressure, metabolic function of the liver and inflammatory cells in patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 3 and liver cirrhosis.

To study if there is a change in perfusion of the heart and calcium score analyzed by heart - rubidium PET/CT scan, after treatment with direct acting antivirals for 8, 12 or 24 weeks in patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1 or 3.

E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial (da): Undersøgelse for viral resistens evalueret ved hjælp af populations sekventering af hepatitis C virus genomet hos patienter i forsøg 1 del 1 med behandlingssvigt. 

Vi ønsker at undersøge effekten af behandling med sofosbuvir /daclatasvir / ribavirin eller sofosbuvir/velpatasvir med og yden ribavirin i 12 uger på betændelsesceller (sCD163), blodtrykket i leveren, det systemiske blodtryk og leverfunktionen hos patienter med kronisk hepatitis C, genotype 3 og levercirrose.

Vi ønsker at undersøge med hjerte-rubidium-PET, om der ses en ændring i hjertets perfusion og ved hjerte-CT om calciumscore ændres efter behandling med direkte virkende antivirale præparater i 8, 12 eller 24 uger hos patienter med kronisk hepatitis C, genotype 1 eller 3. 

E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: Patients of both sexes between 18-70 years
• Patients are followed at one of the 18 departments affiliated with DANHEP, diagnosed with chronic HCV infection (verified by real-time PCR as the presence of HCV RNA in two blood samples taken 6 months apart).
• Treatment-naïve or previous treatment with pegylated interferon / ribavirin or discontinuing treatment with pegylated interferon / ribavirin / telaprevir / boceprevir due to side effects.
• Treatment demanding chronic hepatitis C virus infection.

E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Hepatitis C Infection (HCV) (genotype 1a/1b/4)
E.1.1.1 Medical condition in easily understood language: Hepatitis C infection
E.1.1.2 Therapeutic area: Diseases [C] - Virus Diseases [C02]
MedDRA Classification
E.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:
E.1.2 Version: 20.0
E.1.2 Level: PT

E.1.2 Term: Chronic hepatitis C
E.1.2 System Organ Class: 10021881 - Infections and infestations
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: 1)To evaluate if short course HCV first line treatment (duration based on the viral load in the blood) followed by 12 weeks re-treatment of those failing therapy is non-inferior to a fixed duration of 8 weeks first line treatment followed by 12 weeks re-treatment of those failing therapy, looking at overall HCV cure in patients with minimal fibrosis and chronic HCV (type 1 and 4) infection.

2)To test the benefits and risks of adding adjunctive ribavirin with 4-8 weeks first line therapy.


E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To test whether re-treatment with 12 weeks treatment after failure of first line therapy still achieves cure in the majority of the small proportion failing short-course first line.

To explore whether factors other than baseline HCV viral load influence and therefore better predict the response to  a) short course combined direct acting antivirals (DAA) and b) re-treatment. Factors explored will include the virus characteristics in addition to the factors relating to individuals infected such as age, body mass index and human genetic variation. Factors relating to the immune system will also be assessed

3. At least one detectable viremia 6 months prior to randomisation (by quantitative HCV RNA, qualitative assay or HCV genotype), with no intervening undetectable results 
4. Plasma HCV RNA >LLOQ at screening
5. No evidence of significant liver fibrosis resulting from any aetiology (defined as Fibroscan* score ≤7.1kPa, equivalent to F0-F140, within 180 days prior to planned randomisation or biopsy consistent with mild fibrosis (Ishak score <=2/6) within 180 days prior to planned randomisation)
6. BMI >=18kg/m2 
7. Laboratory tests: platelets >=60x109/l, haemoglobin >12g/dl (male) or >11g/dl (female), creatinine clearance (estimated using Cockcroft-Gault) >=60ml/min, international normalised ratio (INR) <1.5
8. Screening HCV viral load <10,000,000IU/ml
9. Written informed consent obtained from the patient.
If HIV infected, then an additional eligibility criteria is:	
10. On antiretroviral therapy with HIV viral load <50 copies/ml for >24 weeks at the screening visit. 


E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: 1. Previous DAA exposure for this infection (previous treatment with pegylated-interferon and/or ribavirin allowed. DAA treatment for a previously cured infection allowed). 
2. FEMALES ONLY: Lactating, or pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, or not willing to use effective contraception, during the study and for four months after last dose of study medication.
3. FEMALES ONLY: currently taking ethinyl-oestradiol-containing medicinal products such as those contained in most combined oral contraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings.
4. MALES only: planning pregnancy with female partner, or not willing to use effective contraception, during the study and for seven months after last dose of study medication.
5. Malignancy within 5 years prior to screening 
6. Any condition in the judgement of the investigator which might limit the patient’s life expectancy 
7. Currently receiving medication know to interact with study medication (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, dasabuvir, ritonavir, sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, ribavirin, glecaprevir, pibrentasvir; see relevant prescribing information9,10,16,39, Sections 5.3.4, 5.4.4, 5.5.4 and 5.6.4 below, and www.hep-druginteractions.org)
8. Disorder which may cause ongoing liver disease including, but not limited to, active hepatitis B, ongoing alcohol misuse
9. Any disorder which in the opinion of the investigator may have a significant negative impact on the ability of the patient to adhere to the trial regimen	
10. Use of other investigational products within 60 days of screening
11. Known hypersensitivity to any active ingredient and/or excipients of the study medicines, namely Microcrystalline cellulose, Lactose monohydrate, Croscarmellose sodium, Magnesium stearate, Gelatine, Shellac, Propylene glycol, Polyethylene glycol, Ammonium hydroxide, Pregelatinised maize starch, Sodium starch glycolate (type A), Maize starch, Hypromellose, Talc, Ethylcellulose aqueous dispersion, Triacetin, Copovidone, Colloidal anhydrous silica, vitamin E (tocopherol) polyethlyene glycol succinate, sodium stearyl fumarate, Polyvinyl alcohol, Macrogol 3350, Sunset yellow FCF aluminium lake (E110), Colouring agent (E132), Titanium dioxide (E171), Yellow iron oxide (E172), Red iron oxide (E172), Black iron oxide (E172).
12. History of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac disease, in the previous six months
13. Haemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia, sickle-cell anaemia).


E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The primary outcome for the biomarker-stratified duration comparison  is the proportion of patients in each randomised group who achieve Sustained Virological Response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12).
SVR12 is defined as undetectable plasma (HCV RNA <Lower limit of Quantification (LLOQ)) measured at 12 weeks after the end of treatment (first line +/- retreatment) without failure.
Failure is defined as:
- Two consecutive measurements of HCV RNA > LLOQ (taken at least 1 week apart) after two consecutive visits with HCV RNA <LLOQ at any time OR
- Two consecutive measurements of HCV RNA (taken at least one week apart) that >1 log10 increase above HCV RNA nadir on treatment to a value >2000 copies/ml

For the Ribavirin comparison, the primary outcome is the proportion of patients in each randomised group who achieve SVR12 following first line treatment, assessed 12 weeks after the end of treatment.

E.5.1.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: The study is planned to recruit over 2 years, patients will be followed for 24 weeks post end of first line treatment, if they fail first line they will receive another 12 weeks of retreatment and be followed for another 24 weeks post end of treatment. Analysis of the endpoints will be conducted after all participants have completed their follow-up.

The ribavirin comparison can be analysed 12 weeks after the end of treatment when all participants have completed their first line treatment.
E.5.2 Secondary end point(s):  - SVR12 after first-line treatment (where not the primary outcome)
 - SVR12 after the end of the combined first and any re-treatment phases (where not    
    the primary outcome)
- SVR24 after the end of the combined first and any re-treatment phases
- SVR24 after first-line treatment only
- Lack of initial virological response
- Viral load rebound after becoming undetectable
- Serious adverse events
- Grade 3/4 adverse events
- Grade 3/4 adverse events judged definitely/probably related to interventions
- Treatment-modifying adverse events (any grade)
- Grade 3/4 anaemia
- Emergence of resistance-associated HCV variants
- Sensitivity/specificity of point–of-care diagnostic for IL28
- Costs and cost-effectiveness

E.5.2.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: The study is planned to recruit over 2 years, patients will be followed for 24 weeks post end of first line treatment, if they fail first line they will receive another 12 weeks of retreatment and be followed for another 24 weeks post end of treatment. Analysis of the endpoints will be conducted after all participants have completed their follow-up.

E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): - For the PK Lead-in Phase, the appropriateness of the LDV/SOF FDC dose will be assessed by evaluating the steady-state PK of the LDV/SOF FDC. The primary endpoint for determining steady state PK is AUCtau of GS-331007, SOF, and LDV. Additional steady-state PK parameters of GS-331007, SOF, and LDV (e.g., AUClast, Cmax, Tmax, Clast, Tlast, Ctau, λz, CL/F, Vz/F and t½) will be estimated and summarized..

- For the Treatment Phase, the primary safety endpoint is any AE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug (s).
E.5.1.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: - In the PK lead in phase 12 weeks data will be collected at screening Day1, Day 3 and Day 10 following Day 10 visits will be as per the treatment phase.

- treatment phase - Screening, Day 1, Week 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 (and Weeks 16, 20, and 24 for subjects requiring 24 weeks of treatment). AEs will be collected throughout the treatment phase
E.5.2 Secondary end point(s): - For the PK Lead-in Phase, the secondary endpoint will include antiviral activity measurements  including assessment of HCV RNA. AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug will be evaluated as a secondary safety endpoint.

- For the Treatment Phase, the key efficacy endpoint is SVR12 and secondary efficacy endpoints include SVR4, SVR24, breakthrough and relapse. Additional efficacy evaluations may include HCV RNA change from Day 1; ALT normalization; and viral kinetic parameters. Secondary safety endpoints of growth and development measurements will be assessed (e.g. height, weight, and Tanner Stage Assessment).

E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): - For the PK Lead-in Phase, the appropriateness of the LDV/SOF FDC dose will be assessed by evaluating the steady-state PK of the LDV/SOF FDC. The primary endpoint for determining steady state PK is AUCtau of GS-331007, SOF, and LDV. Additional steady-state PK parameters of GS-331007, SOF, and LDV (e.g., AUClast, Cmax, Tmax, Clast, Tlast, Ctau, λz, CL/F, Vz/F and t½) will be estimated and summarized..

- For the Treatment Phase, the primary safety endpoint is any AE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug (s).
E.5.1.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: - In the PK lead in phase 12 weeks data will be collected at screening Day1, Day 3 and Day 10 following Day 10 visits will be as per the treatment phase.

- treatment phase - Screening, Day 1, Week 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 (and Weeks 16, 20, and 24 for subjects requiring 24 weeks of treatment). AEs will be collected throughout the treatment phase
E.5.2 Secondary end point(s): - For the PK Lead-in Phase, the secondary endpoint will include antiviral activity measurements  including assessment of HCV RNA. AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug will be evaluated as a secondary safety endpoint.

- For the Treatment Phase, the key efficacy endpoint is SVR12 and secondary efficacy endpoints include SVR4, SVR24, breakthrough and relapse. Additional efficacy evaluations may include HCV RNA change from Day 1; ALT normalization; and viral kinetic parameters. Secondary safety endpoints of growth and development measurements will be assessed (e.g. height, weight, and Tanner Stage Assessment).

E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To assess the durability of SVR;

To assess clinical progression or regression of liver disease, including the incidence of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following SVR.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To determine whether subsequent detection of HCV RNA in subjects who relapse following
SVR represents the re-emergence of pre-existing virus, the development of resistance
mutations, or re-infection.

To assess quality of life following SVR.
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: 1) Willing and able to provide written informed consent;
2) Have either previously participated in a Gilead-sponsored HCV study and received a sofosbuvir-containing regimen without interferon; OR At pre-selected sites only, have received an all-oral SOF-based regimen outside a clinical study. These subjects must have documentation of the regimen, start and end of treatment dates (month and year), and of
having achieved SVR12
3) Have achieved SVR either in a Gilead-sponsored study, as defined in the treatment protocol; OR for subjects who enroll after receiving an alloral SOF-based regimen outside a clinical study, SVR will be defined as HCV RNA < LLOQ approximately 12 weeks following last dose of treatment.
4) Have liver cirrhosis, as defined in the treatment protocol, and have not had a liver transplant after receiving a SOF-containing regimen; OR Subjects who enroll after receiving an all-oral SOF-based regimen outside a clinical study, will have had cirrhosis as diagnosed prior to initiation of HCV Treatment.
E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: 1) Subject plans to initiate a new course of HCV therapy, including approved products and any
investigational agents, during the course of this Registry;
2) History of clinically-significant illness or any other major medical disorder that may interfere
with the subject follow-up, assessments or compliance with the protocol.
E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): To assess the durability of SVR;

To assess clinical progression or regression of liver disease, including the incidence of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following SVR.
E.5.1.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: The proportion of subjects maintaining SVR at Week 240;

The proportion of subjects who develop liver disease progression or regression, as assessed by clinical and laboratory parameters throughout the study

The proportion of subjects who develop HCC through Week 240.
E.5.2 Secondary end point(s): To determine whether subsequent detection of HCV RNA in subjects who relapse following
SVR represents the re-emergence of pre-existing virus, the development of resistance
mutations, or re-infection.
E.5.2.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: The proportion of subjects with detectable HCV RNA due to re-emergence of pre-existing
virus through Week 240;

The proportion of subjects with detectable HCV resistance mutations through Week 240.

The proportion of subjects with detectable HCV RNA due to re-infection through Week 240.

In consenting participants, (target n=10), blood samples will be collected at one hemodialysis
session between Week 6 and Week 12, inclusive (as appropriate based on treatment regimen). A single blood sample will be collected within 10 minutes before hemodialysis initiates. During hemodialysis, a single sample will be collected from both the arterial and venous sides of the dialyzer approximately 1 hour prior to conclusion of hemodialysis. Finally, a single blood sample will be collected within 10 minutes after hemodialysis concludes.
Plasma concentrations of SOF and LDV and its metabolites will be determined and hemodialysis extraction ratio will be estimated as appropriate.
Plasma concentrations of LDV and SOF and its metabolites will be determined and hemodialysis extraction ratio and fraction of dose removed by dialysis will be estimated as appropriate.
